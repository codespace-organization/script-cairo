// Exercise 28:
// On this exercise you will create a function that returns an array with the following elements:
// hat holds three elements of type felt252. 
// Each element in the array should be initialized as the sum of its index and the previous element,
// starting with the first element as 0.
// Make sure your code compiles and passes the test!

use array::ArrayTrait;
use option::OptionTrait;

fn exercise_twentyeight() -> Array<felt252> {
    let mut a = ArrayTrait::new();

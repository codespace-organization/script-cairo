    // Since the main function does not return anything and only operates on internal logic
    // without any output (like print or returning values), we can only ensure that it compiles.

    // to verify that functions are called with the correct state.
    // For this specific case, we might use logging or a similar side-effect to verify behavior.
    main(); // The success criteria here is that this call does not panic or fail.

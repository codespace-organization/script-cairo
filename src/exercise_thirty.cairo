// Exercise 30:
// On this exercise, you have to implement a function that receives a dictionary and a number n.
// The function should iterate over the dictionary and for each key, it should check if the previous value is even.
// If it is, the current value should be multiplied by 10.
// The function should return the modified dictionary.


fn exercise_thirty(ref dict: Felt252Dict<usize>, n: felt252) {
    // Your code here!
